About the info.plist entries:


Document Types:
---------------
- Deleted the entries which are obsolete as of Mac Leopard OS: 
	 CFBundleTypeExtensions; CFBundleTypeMIMETypes; CFBundleTypeOSTypes
- LSItemContentTypes: Array of UTIs for supported file types.
- NSExportableTypes: Array of UTIs which our application can export.
- LSHandlerRank: For each of the LSItemContentTypes, we indicate whether we 
  are the "Owner" of the type (therefore open it upon double click), or if it's an 
  "Alternate" type (we handle it but don't "own" it), or we don't support it ("None").
